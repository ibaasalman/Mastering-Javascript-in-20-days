## Data Fetching & Promises 🚩 :
The fetch() method starts the process of fetching a resource from a server.
The fetch() method returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object.

## Destructuring Data 🚩 :
The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.

## Async🚩 :
The keyword async before a function makes the function return a promise
The await keyword can only be used inside an async function , The await keyword makes the function pause the execution and wait for a resolved promise before it continues.

## Modules 🚩 :
JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files , This makes it easier to maintain a code-base.

Modules are imported from external files with the import statement.

Modules also rely on type="module" in the <script> tag.
