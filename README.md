# Mastering-Javascript-in-20-days

gsg first learning sprint for the express js course 🏃

## Challenge Details ❔🧐 :
This is a challenge to learn and master Javascript in 20 days or less 🌝 . My goal is to improve my knowledge in javascript and gain a new understanding of the hidden inner details of the language. I also aim to improve my problem-solving skills with js and create new projects 🙌. The online resources used to learn will be the courses on frontEnd Masters and certain coding challenges on freeCodeCamp. Each day I participate in the challenge I'll create a new daily readMe,  and in that page the details of what I learned on the given day will be posted. The links to all the daily readMe pages will also be added in this page down below. Any projects created for this challenge will also be linked in this page.
