# Summary of what i learned today 🧑‍🏫


## JavaScript principles 🚩 :

When JavaScript code runs, it Goes through the code line-by-line and runs/’executes’ each line - known as the thread of execution

Saves ‘data’ like strings and arrays so we can use that data later - in its memory We can even save code (‘functions’)

### Execution context
Created to run the code of a
function - has 2 parts (we’ve
already seen them!)
- Thread of execution
- Memory

### call stack
JavaScript keeps track of what function is currently running (where’s the thread of execution)
- Run a function - add to call stack
- Finish running the function - JS removes it from call stack
- Whatever is top of the call stack that’s the function we’re currently running
  
## Functions & Callbacks 🚩 :

Callbacks and Higher Order Functions simplify our code and keep it DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
