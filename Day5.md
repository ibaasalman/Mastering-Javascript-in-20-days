# Summary of what i learned today üßë‚Äçüè´


## Conditionals üö©

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.

1. Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
2. Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
3. Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false

### Conditional (ternary) operator :

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. This operator is frequently used as an alternative to an if...else statement.

```js
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
```

## Map & filter üö© :

### map()
map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array element , it does not execute the function for empty elements , it does not change the original array.

```js
array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
```

### filter()

# DELIEVERABLES	üíª


## #1 :  Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators

```js
function checkSign(num) {
 
   return num<0?'negative':num>0?'positive':'zero'
}

checkSign(10);
```
